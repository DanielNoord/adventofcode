# Advent of Code

My own solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

Inspired by work and solutions found arond the web.

For 2020 the work of @warbaque was really helpful, see
[here](https://github.com/warbaque/adventofcode-2020)

For 2021 I set the goal of writing all challenges in VIM

For 2022 I'm trying to achieve my goal of 2021 again as I failed miserably... And I
failed again, but did eventually finish all challenges

For 2023 I'm trying to get as far as possible while learning `rust`. I did some of 2019
as a preparation to get some basic experience with doing AOC in `rust`.
